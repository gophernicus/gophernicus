gophernicus (3.0-1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * N.B. this version has two important changes that may make it
    backwards-incompatible:
   * binary changed from in.gophernicus to gophernicus
   * virtual hosting NEVER WORKED and does not work in the way previously
   described
  * Other changes:
   * prevent leak of executable gophermap contents
   * make sure {x,}inetd works when systemd is on the system
   * allow -j flag to work
   * add h9bnks (yargo) and fosslinux into developer roles
   * add -nx flag, blocks executable gophermaps
   * add -nu flag, disable ~/public_gopher
   * modify various documentation to markdown
   * fix various formattings and typos
   * allow inetd targets to work without update-inetd
   * correct handling of inetd.conf
   * remove list of supported platforms
   * remove example gophermaps
   * add dependencies for various distros to INSTALL.md
   * fix query urls
   * add travis ci
   * add documentation about CI
  * Upgrade guide:
   * If you are running gophernicus on a **production** system, **do not** upgrade
     to 3.0. Wait for 3.1.
   * As a general guide,
     * If you are running 101 and haven't upgraded to newer versions **because** of
       instability worries, **wait for 3.1**.
     * If you were running other rolling-release versions, **upgrade now**.
