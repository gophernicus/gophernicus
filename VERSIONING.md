#### Upgrade guide:

If you are running gophernicus on a **production** system, **do not** upgrade to 3.0.
Wait for 3.1.

As a general guide:

If you are running 101 and haven't upgraded to newer versions **because** of
instability worries, **wait for 3.1**.

If you were running other rolling-release versions, **upgrade now**.

## History

Gophernicus has had a rough versioning history.

Versions progressed through to 2.6. Then it changed to a rolling-release scheme.
This dosen't work very well, hence the decision was made to revert to a numbered
versioning scheme. In some places, it was referred to 101 (the git commit
number) or 2.99.101 (2.99.gitcommitnumber).

These days (June 2019), the vast majority of gophernicus servers are on 101.
