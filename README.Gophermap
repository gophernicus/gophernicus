!Sample gophermap for Gophernicus

##
## This is a sample gophermap.
##
#
Creating a file called "gophermap" into a directory disables the
normal resource listing and replaces it with the contents of the map
file. You can also have inline gophermaps - files with a ".gophermap"
extension are parsed as gophermaps and displayed in between normal
resources in alphabetical order.

In a gophermap any line that doesn't contain a <TAB> character is
automatically converted to an type "i" gopher resource which are
displayed as plain text in the client. Lines which contain tabs are
intepreted as gopher resource lines which the client will render as
links. The first line of a gophermap should be a !Title line
describing the menu.

Dynamic gophermaps are possible by making the gophermap a script and
marking it as executable. All script output is parsed just like a
static gophermap, for example lines without tabs are converted to "i"
resources. Executable gophermaps are always ran through the default
shell (/bin/sh) so depending on your operating system that's either
slow, or really unbearably slow...

The format of a gophermap resource line is simple:
Xname<TAB>selector<TAB>host<TAB>port

Where:
   X          is the gopher filetype
   name       is an explanation of the resource
   selector   is the path to resource
   host:port  are the hostname and port number to go to

Type and name are mandatory. If you don't specify a selector, the
name field will be also used as the selector. If you don't specify
host or port the host:port of the current server are used instead.
Also make sure to use ONLY ONE TAB between the fields.

Valid filetypes include:
   0   text file
   1   directory
   3   error message
   5   archive file (zip, tar etc)
   7   search query
   8   telnet session
   9   binary file
   g   GIF image
   h   HTML file
   i   info text
   I   generic image file (other than GIF)
   d   document file (ps, pdf, doc etc)
   s   sound file
   ;   video file
   c   calendar file
   M   MIME file (mbox, emails etc)

Additional type characters supported by Gophernicus:
   #          comment - rest of the line is ignored
   !title     menu title (use on the first line)
   -file      hide file from listings
   :ext=type  change filetype (for this directory only)
   ~          include a list of users with valid ~/public_gopher
   %          include a list of available virtual hosts
   =mapfile   include or execute other gophermap
   *          stop processing gophermap, include file listing
   .          stop processing gophermap (default)

Examples of valid resource lines:

1subdir	
1Relative internal link	subdir
1Absolute internal link	/subdir
1External link 	/	gopher.floodgap.com	70
1External relative link (which shouldn't work)	subdir/	gopher.domain.dom	70
0Finger-to-gopher link	user	example.test	79
hLink to a website	URL:http://www.google.com/

hLink to a local html page	/path/to/file.html
5Link to an tar archive	/path/to/archive.tar.gz
9Link to a binary file	/path/to/binary

7Search engine query	/query
8Telnet session	user	example.test	79

# Hide a few files from the menu listing generated by *
-hiddenfile.txt
-hiddendir

# Change filetypes for this directory
:png=g
:foo=b

Include links to users own gopherspaces:
~

List all available virtual hosts:
%

Include sub-gophermap:
=LICENSE

Execute script and parse output as subgophermap:
=/usr/bin/uptime

Here we stop processing the gophermap and include the regular menu:
