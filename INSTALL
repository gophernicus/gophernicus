Compiling and installing Gophernicus
====================================

Gophernicus requires a C compiler but no extra libraries aside
from standard LIBC ones. Care has been taken to use only
standard POSIX syscalls so that it should work pretty much on
any *nix system.

To compile and install run:

$ gzip -cd gophernicus-*.tar.gz | tar xvf -
$ cd gophernicus-*
$ make
$ sudo make install

That's it - Gophernicus should now be installed, preconfigured
and running under gopher://<HOSTNAME>/. And more often than not,
It Just Works(tm). If gopher links don't seem to work you may
need to configure your public hostname explicitly in whatever
config file Gophernicus is using.

By default Gophernicus serves gopher documents from /var/gopher
although that can be changed by using the -r <root> parameter.
To enable virtual hosting create hostname directories under
the gopher root and make sure you have at least the primary
hostname (the one set with -h <hostname>) directory available
(mkdir /var/gopher/$HOSTNAME).


Compiling with TCP wrappers
===========================

Gophernicus uses no extra libraries... well... except libwrap
(TCP wrappers) if it is installed with headers in default Unix
directories at the time of compiling. If you have the headers
installed and don't want wrapper support, run 'make generic'
instead of just 'make', and if you have wrappers installed in
non-standard place and want to force compile with wrappers
just run 'make withwrap'.

For configuring IP access lists with TCP wrappers, take a look
at the files /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny (because the
manual pages suck). Use the daemon name 'in.gophernicus' to
make your access lists.


Running with traditional inetd superserver
==========================================

If you want to run Gophernicus under the traditional Unix
inetd, add the below line to your /etc/inetd.conf and restart
the inetd process.

gopher  stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/in.gophernicus  in.gophernicus -h <hostname>


Compiling on Debian Linux (and Ubuntu)
======================================

The above commands work on Debian just fine, but if you prefer
having everything installed as packages run "make deb" instead
of plain "make". If all the dependencies were in place you'll
end up with an offical-looking deb package in the parent
directory (don't ask - that's just how it works). And instead
of "sudo make install" you should just install the deb with
"dpkg -i ../gophernicus_*.deb" after which It Should Just
Work(tm).

If you need TCP wrappers support on Debian/Ubuntu, please
install libwrap0-dev before compiling.


Cross-compiling
===============

Cross-compiling to a different target architecture can be done
by defining HOSTCC and CC to be different compilers. HOSTCC
must point to a local arch compiler, and CC to the target
arch one.

$ make HOSTCC=gcc CC=target-arch-gcc


Shared memory issues
====================

Gophernicus uses SYSV shared memory for session tracking and
statistics. It creates the shared memory block using mode 600
and a predefined key which means that a shared memory block
created with one user cannot be used by another user. Simply
said, running in.gophernicus under various different user
accounts may create a situation where the memory block is locked
to the wrong user.

If that happens you can simply delete the memory block and
let Gophernicus recreate it - no harm done:

$ sudo make clean-shm


Porting to different platforms
==============================

If you need to port Gophernicus to a new platform, please take
a look at gophernicus.h which has a bunch of HAVE_* #defines.
Fiddling with those usually makes it possible to compile a working
server. If you succeed in compiling Gophernicus to a new
platform please send the patches to kim@holviala.com so I can 
include them into the next release.
